In this Assignment I learned The Paired t-Test is used to compare the means of two related groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them. It is commonly used in before-and-after studies and ANOVA is used to compare means across multiple groups to determine if at least one differs significantly.

**Paired t-Test**
Key Learnings:
It tests whether the mean difference between two paired samples is significantly different from zero.
Requires the data to be normally distributed.
The p-value helps in decision-making:
If p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant difference.
If p > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning no significant difference.

**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**
Key Learnings:
One-way ANOVA: Compares means of more than two independent groups.
Two-way ANOVA: Examines the effect of two independent variables on a dependent variable.
A low p-value (<0.05) indicates that at least one group mean is significantly different.
Post-hoc tests (like Tukeyâ€™s test) help identify specific differences between groups.
